Brewkit is a open-source, opinionated boilerplate for building full-stack web applications.

**Note:** This project is currently being developed and is subject to change.

As a developer who frequently starts new projects, I found myself repeatedly setting up the same stack with the same configurations. Brewkit standardises this process and provides a solid foundation to create new projects. The name Brewkit comes from the idea of brewing up new projects quickly - like brewing a perfect cup of coffee.

## Tech Stack

The provisional tech stack:

- **Next.js 15** with App Router for server-side rendering and API routes
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **shadcn** for components and styling
- **Supabase** for database and authentication
- **Prisma** for database migrations and schema management
- **Zod** for schema validation
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **Docker** for containerisation

## Getting Started

To use Brewkit, you can simply clone the repository and start building:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harrybaines/brewkit
cd brewkit
bun install
bun dev
```

## What's Next

I'm constantly updating Brewkit with new features and improvements. Some upcoming additions include:

- **Improved documentation**
- **Testing**
- **AI integration**
