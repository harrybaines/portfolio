Recently I stumbled across a tool called posting.

![Posting in action](/images/posts/posting/app.png)

It's a really clean TUI (similar to Postman or Insomnia) that allows you to interact with API's in your terminal. If you're like me and live in the terminal, this one is for you!

### Installation

This is how you install it (see the [README](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting?tab=readme-ov-file) for full instructions):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then install with uv:

```bash
uv tool install --python 3.12 posting
```

If you don't have uv installed:

```bash
brew install uv
```

Then you can run:

```bash
posting
```

Ready to go!

I've been using the tool for a few weeks already, and it's so much more convenient having this in the terminal.

It saves me context switching between multiple separate macOS apps as well, so this definitely keeps me in the flow state for longer!
