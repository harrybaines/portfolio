After banging my head against a brick wall for the best part of half an hour, I finally figured out how to solve:

```bash
go: no modules were found in the current workspace; see 'go help work'
```

I was trying to run a main.go file using

```bash
go run .
```

But couldn't get the issue to go away.

Usually when working with Go projects nowadays you would do something like:

```bash
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
touch main.go
go mod init github.com/<USERNAME>/myproject
go mody tidy
go run .
```

If any of these errors come up:

```bash
go: no modules were found in the current workspace; see 'go help work'
```

or:

```bash
main.go:7:5: no required module provides package github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea: go.mod file not found in current directory or any parent directory; see 'go help modules'
```

Then I would check the following:

- Check go.mod actually exists
- Try setting the following: export GO111MODULE='auto' (ref: https://janusworx.com/work/quick-fix-go-mod-file-not-found-in-current-directory/)
- Check if any go.work files exist. This was my issue - I had one in my root directory, which I had to remove. Then running my Go file worked!

Even ChatGPT struggled with this one ðŸ˜„
